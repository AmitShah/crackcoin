# crackcoin

Crackcoin is a very basic blockchain-free cryptocurrency PoC in Python. It's a project for discovering cryptocurrencies.

Note that this is a PoC that runs only on local networks and does not provide proper security. The code should only be used to get familiar with the building blocks for a cryptocurrency.

This project was created as an exercise after reading "Mastering Bitcoin: unlocking digital cryptocurrencies".

## Material covered

- Transaction-based mining as a PoC for a blockchain-free cryptocurrency
- Threading in Python
- Working with sockets in Python (UDP)
- ECC crypto / ECC public key compression/decompression
- Base58 encoding like bitcoin
- Having the whole thing work (wallet, crypto, validation, networking, mining, etc)

## Blockchain-free cryptocurrencies

Most cryptocurrencies use a blockchain to validate transactions among other things. After years of running these networks it's beginning to look like blockchain-based currencies naturally evolve into a centralised network, because it's in the best interest of the participants to combine computing power to calculate solutions for blocks.

An interesting framework for a blockchain-free protocol is discussed in the paper "Blockchain-Free Cryptocurrencies: A Framework for Truly Decentralised Fast Transactions", which can be found here:

Do note that crackcoin doesn't implement nearly as complex a protocol as described in the paper. But the transaction-based mining method was used as an inspiration for implementing the 'core' for crackcoin.

## Usage

### Running it normally

- First run `python crackcoin.py`
- Then type `h` to see options and communicate with other crackcoin-nodes on the network

### Generating and working with your own genesis transaction

- Run `python generateGenesis.py` until a cool address pops up
- Edit crackcoinBase.sql: replace the address for the transaction with transactionHash d34db33f in `transactions_outputs` with your generated address
- Run crackcoin and wait until a confirmation is generated for d34db33f with a higher difficulty (>6) than the one in crackcoinBase.sql
- Replace the confirmation for d34db33f
- Share code on other nodes
- Manually replace your wallet keys and address with the address and keys generated by generateGenesis.py. This will allow you to 'spend' the genesis cash.
